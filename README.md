# Advanced IIS Application Pool Settings

The advanced settings in IIS Application Pools cannot be configured using the default IIS tasks provided by Microsoft (except when using appcmd.exe). This extension fills that gap. This task is still in preview, so we're working on extending the feature set. If you want to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request to our Github account!

The task uses WinRM. It is currently only tested with IIS on Windows Server 2012 R2. Please let us know if you successfully used it on other OS'es.
